I’m Dan Cryer, a technical leader and software development specialist based in Bollington, Cheshire. I’ve been working in tech professionally for around 20 years now, and as a hobby since my early teens. I’ve been involved in more projects than I could or would want to count.

Currently Technology Director at Gear4music.com, following several years of running Block 8 Digital, a bespoke software development agency. I've worked with many industries, including marketing, media, insurance, eCommerce, charity, government and more.

I’m a compassionate and people-focused leader with an extensive background in software engineering, devops and infrastructure. I’m equally comfortable debugging software issues, or talking strategy in a boardroom, implementing cloud infrastructure changes or teaching people about neurodiversity.

Throughout my career I’ve worked in-house, freelance and in agency, on projects and systems of all shapes and sizes. I’ve taken on the role of software engineer, system administrator, product manager and digital consultant.

I’m highly pragmatic and love to solve difficult problems, whether they are organisational, product, process or technical. My greatest strengths have proven to be my enthusiasm, communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and bias for action in getting things done.

I enjoy spending time with family and being outdoors. I'm a qualified Lowland (walking) Leader and Camping Leader, and enjoy paddlesports and bouldering.
