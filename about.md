I’m Dan Cryer, a technical leader and software development specialist based in Bollington, Cheshire. I’ve been working in tech professionally for around 20 years now, and as a hobby since my early teens. I’ve been involved in more projects than I could or would want to count.

Currently Technology Director at Gear4music.com, following several years of running Block 8 Digital, a bespoke software development agency. I've worked with many industries, including marketing, media, insurance, eCommerce, charity, government and more.

I enjoy spending time with family and being outdoors. I'm a qualified Lowland (walking) Leader and Camping Leader, and enjoy paddlesports and bouldering.
