I don't usually write about music, nor really much else other than technology - but since my friend [Dougie](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Douglas-Francis/264579313605550" target="_blank) is starting his debut acoustic tour this weekend, I'd make an exception!

Dougie is an acoustic singer, songwriter and producer, with his own [his first EP "Toy Box"](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/toy-box/id515327438" target="_blank) last year and is gearing up to release his second later this year.

If you live anywhere near Macclesfield, Leeds, York, Sheffield, Nottingham or Matlock - go and watch him! He'd probably also like it if you bought his EP.
