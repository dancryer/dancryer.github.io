I've been running dancryer.com on a shared hosting account and block8.co.uk (+ client sites) on AppFog for a while now.

As of today, it is finally all back running on a server completely under my control!

For the geeky amongst you, the server is Ubuntu, running Nginx and PHP-FPM (with FastCGI caching and APC.) It may just be me, but it feels an awful lot snappier so far.
