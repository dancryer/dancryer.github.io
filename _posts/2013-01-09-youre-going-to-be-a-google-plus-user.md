I'm so glad that someone has finally written this article, as I really believe it is true, and we'll increasingly find people using Google+ without even realising. Right from the very beginning, Google has made it clear that Google+ isn't a separate service - <strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Google+ is the future of Google</strong>.

Google+ is going to be the core of everything that Google do going forward, every new service will add to it or feed from it in some way, and you're going to be using it whether you like it or not.
