Two years ago now, I created a CouchDb Client library for PHP called [Composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/chill/chill" target="_blank), but otherwise largely just forgot about it and left it on Github.

As it turns out, a number of people have started using it in real world projects, and a couple of people have even made forks and submitted pull requests to fix bug reports. All this despite the fact that I'd neglected to ever tag a release, so the Composer package could only be used in "unstable" form.

As a result, today I've accepted the pending pull requests, properly licenced the library under the BSD 2 Clause licence and "officially" tagged version 1.0.0. If you want to use it, you can either get it from Github or require `chill/chill` as a dependency in Composer.

If you do use it, I'd love to hear about what you're using it for!
